For Basic Steamed Cake
Gather all the ingredients.
In a medium bowl, combine all-purpose flour and baking powder and whisk well to combine (shortcut for sifting).
In a small bowl, whisk the egg, milk, sugar, and vegetable oil together until combined.

Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and mix until smooth.

Put a cupcake liner in glass ramekins and divide the batter into the cupcake liners.

Place the glass ramekins in the boiling water and cook covered on the lowest heat for 8 minutes.

They're done when a skewer inserted comes out clean without wet batter. Turn off the heat and remove the ramekins from the pan and let them cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.
